Built an AI Employee system that actually works. 🤖

Here's what makes it different:

Instead of replacing humans, it handles the repetitive stuff while keeping you in control. The system monitors emails, prioritizes tasks, and drafts responses—but nothing gets sent without your approval.

The architecture is simple:
✅ File-based workflow (no complex databases)
✅ Priority-based task processing (URGENT > TASK > INFO)
✅ Multi-channel monitoring (Gmail, WhatsApp, LinkedIn)
✅ Human-in-the-loop for critical decisions
✅ Complete audit trail in markdown files

Key insight: The best automation isn't about doing everything automatically. It's about surfacing the right information at the right time so you can make better decisions faster.

Real impact? Tasks that used to take 30 minutes now take 2 minutes of review time.

The system runs on Python, uses Claude for intelligence, and stores everything in organized folders. No vendor lock-in, no black boxes—just transparent automation you can understand and control.

What's your approach to AI automation? Do you prefer full automation or human-in-the-loop?
