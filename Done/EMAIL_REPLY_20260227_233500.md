## Body

Dear Team,

Thank you for your inquiry regarding the project status.

I'm pleased to confirm that the Bronze Tier has been successfully completed with all core functionality operational.

Regarding the Silver Tier, I can provide the following status update:

Fully Operational Components:
- Gmail Watcher: Successfully monitoring inbox with OAuth 2.0 authentication
- Email Processing: Draft generation and sending functionality working correctly
- File Watcher: Automated file monitoring and task creation system active
- Skills System: AI-powered content generation for emails and LinkedIn posts
- LinkedIn Posting: Manual posting workflow implemented and tested

Components with Limitations:
- LinkedIn Automation: Automated posting encounters anti-bot detection; manual workflow serves as reliable alternative
- WhatsApp Integration: Deferred due to WSL2 environment constraints with QR code authentication

Overall Assessment:
The system demonstrates robust functionality across all critical workflows. The human-in-the-loop approval process is working as designed, ensuring quality control before any automated actions are executed.

I'm available to provide a detailed demonstration or address any specific functionality questions you may have.

Best regards,
Huzaifa Qazi
