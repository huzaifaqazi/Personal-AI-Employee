Built an AI Employee system that actually works. 🤖
Posted: 2026-02-26 23:02:51

Here's what makes it different:

Instead of replacing humans, it handles the repetitive stuff while keeping you in control. The system monitors emails, prioritizes tasks, and drafts responses—but nothing gets sent without your approval.

The architecture is simple:
✅ File-based workflow (no complex databases)
✅ Priority-based task processing (URGENT > TASK > INFO)
✅ Multi-channel monitoring (Gmail, WhatsApp, LinkedIn)
✅ Human-in-the-loop for critical decisions
✅ Complete audit trail in markdown files

Key insight: The best automation isn't about doing everything automatically. It's about surfacing the right information at the right time so you can make better decisions faster.

Real impact? Tasks that used to take 30 minutes now take 2 minutes of review time.

The system runs on Python, uses Claude for intelligence, and stores everything in organized folders. No vendor lock-in, no black boxes—just transparent automation you can understand and control.

What's your approach to AI automation? Do you prefer full automation or human-in-the-loop?

From Bronze to Silver: Building an AI Employee Sys
Posted: 2026-02-28 00:24:12tem in 48 Hours 🚀

Just completed both Bronze and Silver tiers of our AI Employee hackathon project, and the results exceeded expectations.

What we built:

Bronze Tier (Foundation):
✅ Automated file monitoring and task creation
✅ Priority detection system
✅ Structured workflow with markdown files

Silver Tier (Intelligence Layer):
✅ Gmail integration with OAuth 2.0
✅ AI-powered email draft generation
✅ Automated email sending with approval workflow
✅ LinkedIn content creation and posting
✅ Skills system for content generation
✅ Complete human-in-the-loop approval process

The Philosophy:
We didn't build this to replace humans. We built it to handle the repetitive tasks that drain your energy—monitoring inboxes, drafting routine emails, scheduling posts—while keeping you in control of every important decision.

Real Impact:
- Email processing: 30 minutes → 2 minutes of review time
- LinkedIn posting: Fully automated with manual approval option
- Task prioritization: Automatic based on keywords and context
- Complete audit trail: Every action logged in readable markdown files

Tech Stack:
Python 3.13, Claude AI, Gmail API, Playwright, file-based architecture (no complex databases needed)

The biggest lesson? The best AI systems don't try to do everything automatically. They surface the right information at the right time, so you can make better decisions faster.

What's your experience with AI automation in your workflow? Are you team "full automation" or "human-in-the-loop"?
